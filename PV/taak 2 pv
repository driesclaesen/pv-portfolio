1. Conditional breakpoints allow you to break inside a code block when a defined expression evaluates to true.
2. In the context of computer programming, instrumentation refers to an ability to monitor or measure the level of a product's performance, to diagnose errors, and to write trace information.[1] Programmers implement instrumentation in the form of code instructions that monitor specific components in a system (for example, instructions may output logging information to appear on the screen). When an application contains instrumentation code, it can be managed by using a management tool.    Instrumentation is necessary to review the performance of the application. Instrumentation approaches can be of two types: source instrumentation and binary instrumentation.
3. A non-deterministic bug is one that will occur under certain circumstances. For example, code that works on user input and raises an unhandled exception.
